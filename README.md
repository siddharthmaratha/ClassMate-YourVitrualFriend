# ClassMate-Your Vitrual Friend

We can see due to Covid-19 Pandemic, everything is shut down and so the schools and colleges. Online study is fine but many students face difficulties in online way like in Managing their time schedule, finding the resources and the materials, which they have to collect from different places. So we thought, what if we can collect all the resources and put them at a single place so that it will be easy for everyone to use them.
So here we presents you "ClassMate - Your Virtual Friend" where we provide you all the Study Materials, Notes, Books, Course Syllabus, Practice Questions and a Time Table Generator- which will make your schedule, these all at a single place. Our Time Table Generator needs you to input your Subjects and their difficulty level for you respectively, and then it will generate a Time Table for you in a way that you can master your difficult and easy subjects, all if you follow the Schedule.
